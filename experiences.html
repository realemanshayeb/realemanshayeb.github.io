    <h1>Experiences</h1>
    <p>
      A snapshot of my academic, research, and leadership experiences across
      physics, AI, engineering, and creative work.
    </p>

      <h2>Research & Academics</h2>
      <p>
        I am an Engineering Science student with a strong foundation in physics,
        mathematics, and machine learning. My research experience spans top-tier
        academic labs, where I’ve worked on generative models, diffusion-based
        systems, and applied AI for visual and multimodal tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been awarded competitive research funding (including ESROP) and have
        contributed to projects involving deep learning architectures, model
        training pipelines, and experimental evaluation.
      </p>

      <h2>Technical Experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Deep learning with PyTorch and Hugging Face Diffusers</li>
        <li>Generative models: diffusion, autoregressive, and VAEs</li>
        <li>Python, data pipelines, and experimental ML workflows</li>
        <li>Signal processing and systems-level analysis</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Leadership & Teaching</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond research, I’ve taken on leadership and mentorship roles through
        design teams, tutoring, and academic support. As a national scholarship
        holder and experienced tutor, I enjoy helping students navigate both
        technical material and the broader challenges of university life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I value creating supportive, human-centered environments where learning
        feels collaborative rather than isolating.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Creative Practice</h2>
      <p>
        Alongside my technical work, I maintain an active creative practice in
        visual art and music. I see creativity and engineering as deeply connected:
        both are about exploration, iteration, and building meaning from complex
        systems.
